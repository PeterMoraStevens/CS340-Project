    <p>Welcome to the Paws & Pastries Cat Cafe! We partner with the local Humane Society to provide a living space for
        15-25 cats at a time, and help connect felines to forever families. Patrons can study and purchase drinks from
        the cafe, or relax and play with the cats in the cat lounge.</p>
